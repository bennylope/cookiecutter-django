# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# The main reason for having this file is for flake8 configuration. You
# shouldn't need to run your project tests across different Python or Django
# versions. However in the event you are considering upgrading and want to
# ensure that everything works in parallel versions, or just need to
# ensure that your local test environment includes exactly the dependency
# versions specified and nothing else, this can be very helpful.
